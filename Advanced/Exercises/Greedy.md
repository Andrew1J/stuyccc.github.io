### Greedy Algorithms

A good way to go about solving problems is to start by asking yourself what observations you can make about the problem that you might be able to exploit to arrive at a solution. For all of the problems below, this strategy will help you solve the problem. Try to not only come up with an algorithm that you think works, but try to come up with a short explanaion that *proves* that your algorithm will always produce the correct answer.

##### Practice:

- Codeforces: [Minimize the Permutation](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1256/B). Try to do it in $O(n)$ time.
