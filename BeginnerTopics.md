This is a list of recommended topics for the beginner section.

#### Procedural Programming in Python

- Simple Data Types
	- integer ("int")
	- string ("str")
	- decimal number ("float")
	- boolean ("bool")
	- None

- Simple Operators
	- arithmetic: +, -, \*, /, %, //, \*\*
	- comparison: >, <, <=, >=, ==, !=
	- logical: and, or, not
	- order of operations
	- what does each operator take in, and what does it return? (sometimes the returned value depends on what was put in!)

- Expressions with many operators
	- can we write some simple expressions, and predict what they will output?

- Variables
	- assignments
	- augmented assignments (+=, -=, etc.) (perhaps best to teach this along with member functions)

- Simple Linear Data Structures
	- tuples, lists, (and strings)
	- a new "operator": indexing!
	- slicing

- Built-in Functions
	- value-returning: str, int, abs, len, min, max, sum, all, any, range, ord, chr
	- I/O: print, input, raw_input

- Control Flow
	- "in" operator
	- if, elif, else
	- while, for
	- continue, break

- Member Functions
	- list: append, insert, pop, sort, index
	- string: split, strip, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, index, replace, lower, upper

- More I/O
	- files: open, read, readline, readlines, write, close

- More Data Structures
	- set: add, remove
	- dict: new "indexing", literals

- Functions
	- start with functions that don't return anything
	- note similarity in calling functions we already know how to use, like len, range, etc.
